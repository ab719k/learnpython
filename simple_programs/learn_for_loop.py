# Loops give computers a set of instructions that are continually repeated. 
# In a for loop, the computer executes the command for a fixed number of times. 
# In our case, this is defined by the range.

for x in range(1,6):
   print (x)

# Next Steps:
# 1) change range from 6 to 100
# 1.1) Do a negative count i.e. from 60 to 1, to calculate 60 seconds
# 2) Set an infinite loop using while True:
# 3) Get the current date and time using strftime() and display on screen.
# 4) Finally, add 1 second delay in a script using sleep(1).
# 5) Continue this procedure till user interrupts.
